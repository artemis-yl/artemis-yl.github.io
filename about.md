## Hello again, my name is Artemis Lee. 

I'm a canadian computer science student currently live in the GTA.

On a more personal level, I enjoy many art & crafts such as knitting and crochet, love to read books, and fancy myself a good cook and baker. I have fun playing video games with my friends and being with my family's 5 dogs. One of my personal goals is to improve my Korean and my German to fluency, as well as learn more cybersecurity and general IT for my own online privacy and security. I love to help out and advise my friends and coworkers, and enjoy hearing about their passions! 

Professionally, as mentioned on my main page, I'm an entry-level Mechanical Engineer and I'm currently looking for a job. Most of my details have already been said, but to give a brief rehash:
* I have experience working as an intern in process engineering, team projects in basic robotics & machine design through CAD, and as a tehcnician for wheelchair & electric mobility devices. 
* Some of my most practiced skills are 2D/3D CAD modeling, troubleshooting electronic devices & software, and hands-on manufactoring in carbon-fiber, piping systems, and tools (both powered and non-powered). 
* I am also excellent at collaborating and organizing teams, learning new skills and knowledge for the job, adapting to set-backs and issues, and getting along with a wide range of personalities and backgrounds. 
* Professional, mature, and emotionally intelligent are key traits I admire and emulate. I know when to be concise and to the point versus engaging and conversational, and when to hunker down to work, set aside distractions and keep myself on schedule. I understand that everyone has different background and that mistakes happen, so it is best to be kind and focus on fixing/prevention rather than blame. 
* I hope to work with amazing people and in a position where I can use my hard-worked skills!
