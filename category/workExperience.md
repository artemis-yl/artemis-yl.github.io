### Methanol Production System - Prototype design, assembly and testing
*	Ensured adherence to the Ontario Gas codes by designing safety control systems for the methanol production process system, participating in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis and incorporating safety relief valves.
*	Acted as key point of contact with a prototype’s off-site operator by receiving weekly reports and troubleshooting issues via emails or in-person visits to the operator’s location, minimizing prototype downtime.

### Design, Construction and Installation of New Workspaces 
*	Led space planning efforts by preparing AutoCAD drawings and Inventor models of equipment arrangement / layouts after conducting site visits of work areas, offices, equipment, and process piping systems.
*	Took initiative to install and calibrate the electronic and automated process instruments, such as the PLC units, solenoid valves and data transmitters, for the electrical engineer, successfully remotely controlling and monitoring key valves and processes of various prototype systems within the main office .
*	Oversaw the installation of a hydrogen vent stack, including contacting the building owner for permits, converting a 3D AutoCAD file into 2D drawings, and creating manufacturing drawings for the assembler

### General Engineering & Design
*	Collaborated with chemical/electrical engineers to design, assemble and test chemical process systems, selecting and procuring parts and instruments that met material compatibility and other requirements.
* Troubleshooted chemical process systems (ex. leak tests), validating safety, preventing loss of product and revenue during operation, and ensuring product quality and production rates met target levels.
* Designed and installed sight tubes with level sensors for the electrolyser system, within a week from a limited selection of parts at the office, to visually confirm and remotely log water levels.
*	Validated the structural integrity of an electrolyser part via ANSYS Workbench to target safety factor of 2, reducing stress concentrations and mass (and thus the overall cost) of the part.
*	Determined the most inexpensive sheet metal and supplier for an equipment skid with a max. deflection of 2.5mm, calculating on Excel the minimum thickness and most economical alloy through stress calculations.

### General Document and Record Keeping
* Improved productivity by eliminating repeating and out-of-date information in the company database, updating BOMs, expanding the 3D and 2D CAD part library, merging duplicate drawings, creating work instructions for past products, and editing other project documentation.
*	Created the company’s official Excel sheet template for documenting the structural analysis and stress calculations of any construction or piping system project
*	Liaised with suppliers to obtain quotes, schedule delivery, and evaluate the status of delivered equipment, ensuring process systems were completed within schedule.
