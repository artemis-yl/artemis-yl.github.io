## Here are some of the projects I have done
in reverse chronological order.

Note that these aren't all of the project I have worked on! Creating these pages and editing them is an ongoing project. Currently all of the following are nearly complete - they only require final editting/formatting.

[comment]: # (Posts will get auto linked w/ a date I can make. However, I cannot make a blurb under each link.)

[comment]: # (I might convert to ```layout:page``` in order to do that and just link it manually.) 

### [Capstone with SolarShip](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2019/04/30/Capstone.html) <sub> Sept 2018 - Apr 2019 </sub>
> I collaborated on a team of 4 to design an airship ballonet regulating valve. This was a year-long capstone project.


### [Turtlebot2 Coding Challenges](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2019/04/09/turtlebot2.html) <sub> Jan - Apr 2019 </sub>
> Collaborated with 3 others to design and code the Turtlebot to complete 3 challenges: 1) mapping and object avoidance, 2) path planning and image identification, and 3) emoting and user interaction.

### [Lac Megantic Accident Analysis](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2019/04/11/AccidentAnalysis.html) <sub> Jan - Apr 2019 </sub>
> With 3 other teammates, we researched the accident to apply CAST, a systems-engineering approach to accident analysis.
> **Note:** Only contains images and very rough sentences.

### [PID Controls: Motorized Pendulum](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2018/12/05/PIDpendulum.html) <sub> Sept - Dec 2018 </sub>
> I cooperated on a team to create PIDs controls that would force a rotor-powered pendulum to always be at a set angle. Any displacement would be immediately corrected.

### [Lap Joint: FEA and Design](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2017/04/07/LapJoint.html) <sub> Jan - Apr 2017 </sub>
> I worked with a partner to design a lap joint between an acrylic and aluminum sheet. We usd FEA on ANSYS and iterated design with Solidworks to reduce weight and determine the highest Ultimate Strength.

### [Heat Sink Testing](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2017/04/07/HeatSinks.html) <sub> Jan - Apr 2017 </sub>
> I worked on a lab team of 4 to find the optimal placements of 2 heat sinks on 3 heating blocks.  I derived the modifided heat transfer equations and also coded in MatLab the Gauss-Seidel numerical method to solve the temperature of each node.

### [Automaton Toy Design](https://96yrlee.github.io/projects/2016/12/02/NutcrackerToy.html) <sub> Sept - Dec 2016 </sub>
> Cooperating with 4 other members, we created a nutcracker automaton that would crack a walnut using realistically human motions of someone swinging a hammer down.

# List of all projects

[comment]: # (eventually, I might get so many that I'll only have blurbs for a few and just list the rest.) 

[comment]: # (although, in that case i might just use collapsibles instead. Keep good ones on top, hide the rest. MAybe by year)
