# Hi, I'm Artemis
I am currently a 2nd-year computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. This is my 2nd-degree, my 1st was in mechanical engineering at University of Toronto. I still love CAD work and product design, so with this additional background I hope to go into mechatronics and machine design.

I have experience in process engineering, solid mechanics and mechatronics, and have gained skills in testing/troubleshooting and in various fabrication methods. 

**I am currently looking for a day job where I can work with an dynamic team and be part of a company that values its employees and the impact they have on its success.**

**More specifically, I am seeking a position** while I continue my studies. Ideally I will be able to use my skills in CAD and prototyping, but I would also love a position where I can use my growing coding and electronic skills. 

[comment]: # ( s a mechanical/mechatronics/process engineer or designer, though I can also transition into quality, programming and consulting. I will accept contract and part-time positions, and am also willing to relocate, travel for work, and to work both remotely and on-site. )

**During my undergraduate at University of Toronto**, I specialized in Solid Mechanics and Machine Design, and gained a minor in Robotics & Mechatronics. Afterwards, I took various online courses such as Six Sigma, Java programming, statistic with SAS and others.

**As for skills and experience**, while interning for Isowater I gained hands-on experience in the design, manufacturing and testing of process systems; For U of T's Blue Sky Solar Car team, I was a carbon-fiber fabricator and machinist for the chassis; And from various projects I have hands-on experience designing, calibrating and troubleshooting electronics, machines and code. I recently also worked as a wheelchair technician where I specialed in customizing and repairing electric mobility devices.

As a result, I have skills ranging from CAD design, preparing technical documents and selecting parts/materials, to researching new products, troubleshooting technical errors and communicating with a variety of professionals both internal and external to the company.

I am also capable of collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, working independently without supervision, delivering results on schedule in a demanding environment, adapting to set backs and new tasks, and getting along with a wide range of personalities and backgrounds. 

**In the future,** I plan on obtaining my P.Eng! I hope to become an expert in machine design, mastering software like SolidWorks, AutoCAD and ANSYS, and mastering stress analysis, dynamics & kinematics, quality assurance and material selection. I also hope to expand into mechatronics and general programming, and learn more skills related to sensors and motors, PLCs and microprocessors. I am also considering an M. Eng.

## What am I Doing Right Now?

**I am currently:**
- looking for a job
- Taking various CAD and FEA tutorials/courses.
- Expanding my programming skills in both robotics, IT and automation.


**I have just completed:**
- Computer Vision Basics via Coursera
  - I learned the basics of digital imagery, theory on the algoriythm, and how to manipulate images via MATLAB
- Six Sigma Green Belt Certificate via Coursera
  - I learned about the DMAIC design cycle, Kaisen, basic statistics, aspects of LEAN, and how to apply these to drive improvement and reduce errors.
- Android App Development Certificate via Coursera
  - I learned Java syntax and object oriented programming, the Android architecture and compoenents, and the basics of code quality assurance.

## Website Progress
This website is undergoing improvements. You may notice some pages are too long, or some basic formatting/spelling errors.

### Website Theme Credit
This website jekyll theme is [Hydeout by Andrew Fong](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). I've made a few minor changes to how categories work but otherwise its the same.

The markdown parser is kramdown. If I ever find one that has better tables, has image size editing, video linking, and collapsibles then I'll switch.
