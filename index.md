# Hi, I'm Artemis
I am currently a 3rd-year computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. This is my 2nd-degree, my 1st was in mechanical engineering at University of Toronto. I still love CAD work and product design, so with this additional background I hope to go into mechatronics and machine design.

I have experience in robotics, process engineering, and solid mechanics, and have gained skills in testing/troubleshooting and in various fabrication methods. 

**I am currently looking for a day job where I can work with an dynamic team and be part of a company that values its employees and the impact they have on its success.**

### Note: I am currently updating my portfolio website! 
Last updated August of 2025. I will be changing Jekyll themes and giving this portfolio a refresh as I take CCPS530 - Intro to Web Development.



[comment]: # ( s a mechanical/mechatronics/process engineer or designer, though I can also transition into quality, programming and consulting. I will accept contract and part-time positions, and am also willing to relocate, travel for work, and to work both remotely and on-site. )

**During my undergraduate at University of Toronto**, I specialized in Solid Mechanics and Machine Design, and gained a minor in Robotics & Mechatronics. Afterwards, I took various online courses such as Six Sigma, Java programming, statistic with SAS and others.

**As for skills and experience**, while interning for Isowater I gained hands-on experience in the design, manufacturing and testing of process systems; For U of T's Blue Sky Solar Car team, I was a carbon-fiber fabricator and machinist for the chassis; And from various projects I have hands-on experience designing, calibrating and troubleshooting electronics, machines and code. I recently also worked as a wheelchair technician where I specialed in customizing and repairing electric mobility devices.

As a result, I have skills ranging from CAD design, preparing technical documents and selecting parts/materials, to researching new products, troubleshooting technical errors and communicating with a variety of professionals both internal and external to the company.

I am also capable of collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, working independently without supervision, delivering results on schedule in a demanding environment, adapting to set backs and new tasks, and getting along with a wide range of personalities and backgrounds. 

**In the future,** I plan on obtaining my P.Eng! I hope to become an expert in mechatronics, mastering software like SolidWorks, AutoCAD and ANSYS, and my software engineering skills. I also hope to learn more about sensors and motors, PLCs and microprocessors. I am also considering an M. Eng.

### Website Theme Credit
This website jekyll theme is [Hydeout by Andrew Fong](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). I've made a few minor changes to how categories work but otherwise its the same.

The markdown parser is kramdown. If I ever find one that has better tables, has image size editing, video linking, and collapsibles then I'll switch.
