## Introduction <a name="1"></a>

I worked with Peter to do this. We worked on seperate ideas: Glue vs Fasteners, and both made CAD Models and did FEA. We both wrote and edited the report.

**Material Properties of the Given Mateials**

|          | Young’s Modulus | Yield Strength | Poisson’s Ratio | Density    |
|:--------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|
| PMMA     | 3.1 GPa         | 70 MPa         | 0.35            | 1.19 g/cm3 |
| AA110-O  | 68.9 GPA        | 34 MPa         | 0.33            | 2.77 g/cm3 |
| Epoxy    | 3780 GPA        |  16.7 MPa      | 0.35            | 1.16 g/cm3 |

## Creating the Design <a name="2"></a>

### 3D Model with Dimension: <a name="2a"></a>

### ANSYS Set Up and Results: <a name="2b"></a>

| Mesh of the joint.<br> The mesh was refined around the holes seen here, <br> and at the epoxy layer hidden from view. | A force type load was applied at the PMMA loading hole, seen as a red vector.<br> A fixed support was applied at the other loading hole, indicated as ‘A’. | Maximum stress at the loading holes.<br> Other points of interest were the thin arms about the hole, <br> which had a larger deflection. 

**Convergence of Stress**

## Physical Test Results and Future Work <a name="3"></a>

We decided, due the brittle nature of the acrlic and due to the fact we were designing to ultimate failure, we should have used a flexible bonding material. For example, a foam tape. We also should have reduced the area on the acrylic that would have attached to the aluminum plate.

## Notes:
Mainly just images - more work to come.
